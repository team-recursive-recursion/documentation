	\section{System Overview}    
	\paragraph{}
	The project will allow golf course owners/managers to draw their golf course using the provided web application. While drawing the golf course, details about the map can be added, such as locations of the hole, green, fairway, or any obstacles and hazardous areas.
Golf players will be able to view the map via their Android phones, enabling them to have a hands-on digital map with details of the course. This will allow the user to plan their shots better and more strategically.
