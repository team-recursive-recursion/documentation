    \section{Overview}

    \subsection{Purpose}

    This Software Requirements Specification (henceforth SRS) is intended to be
    a guide on the path of developing the Golf Course Mapper system. It will
    aid the developers by providing a layout of the project requirements.

    \subsection{Scope}

    Golf players require an application that allows them to view golf courses
    during play. Although there are existing platforms that aim to achieve this
    goal, many of them are simply mappers and do not allow the player to view
    their location on the map.
    
    Furthermore, the proprietary and commercial nature of existing products
    make them difficult to be used widely and therefore contain only a handful
    of mapped courses. The Golf Course Mapper will attempt to achieve these
    goals by providing a rich set of features for both the course managers and
    players through an open source platform.

    The Golf Course Mapper will allow golf course managers to draw the shape of
    their courses using a web application. The owners will map out the details
    of the golf course. This includes mapping the layout of the fairway, green,
    sand and water hazards and details such as the position of the hole and the
    teeing grounds. Additionally, owners will be allowed to view their courses
    and see the locations of active players currently using the mobile
    application.

    Players currently on the course will be able to use the provided mobile
    application to view the map of the course and where they are on it
    currently. This has the benefit of allowing players to plan their shots
    more strategically. The app will show the distances between the player and
    various points of interest (such as the hole), further aiding the player
    during play.

    The Golf Course Mapper is not a coaching tool and does not provide a
    channel of communication between the mapper and the player. The web
    application is not to be used by coaches, but solely by managers that wish
    to map out the details of their courses and view its current state. The
    Golf Course Mapper is also not a social media platform for golfers and will
    not allow communication among players.

    \subsection{Definitions, Acronyms \& Abbreviations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            System: Henceforth used to refer to the Golf Course Mapper system
            as a whole.
        \item
            Manager: The manager or owner of a golf course, henceforth used to
            refer to the user of the website.
        \item
            Player: A golf player, henceforth used to refer to the users of the
            mobile application.
        \item
            Website: A web application that is used by golf course managers
            to draw the layout of their golf courses.
        \item
            Mobile App: A native Android mobile app that golf players can use to
            view the golf course.
        \item
            Location: A position on the map, modelled using latitude and longitude
            coordinates.
        \item
            Point: A point of interest, such as the hole or tee location.
            Points are represented as a single location on the golf course.
        \item
            Area: Specific areas on the golf course, such as the green or the
            fairway. Areas consist of an ordered set of locations, forming a
            polygon.
        \item
            DBMS: Database Management System.
        \item
            API: Application Programming Interface.
        \item
            Back End: The server side that consists of both the DBMS and the
            API.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Domain Model}

    Refer to figure \ref{fig:domainmodel}, which represents the domain model of
    the system. At the core of the domain model is the \textit{Course} which
    represents a single area where \textit{Players} can go to play the game of
    golf. Each Player is associated with a single Course on which the Player is
    currently playing. Each Course has an assigned \textit{Manager} that is
    solely responsible for mapping and managing the information of the Course.
    Note that a Manager can be assigned to more than one Course.

    Each Course has one or more \textit{Holes} associated with it. A Hole
    represents a single playable map with different map \textit{Elements},
    containing information. The Elements can be of two different types:
    \textit{Point} Elements and \textit{Area} Elements. A Point Element
    represents single-point information of a Hole such as the teeing grounds,
    location of the hole and other points of interest. Area Elements represent
    area information of a Hole, such as the area of the rough, fairway, green
    and water and sand hazards. Areas are represented as polygons.

    A Course may also optionally have Elements that are not associated with a
    specific Hole. This allows the specification of Elements such as points of
    interest or hazardous areas such as bodies of water that may be important
    to more than one Hole. It therefore does not make sense to associate these
    Elements with a specific Hole, but rather with the Course as a whole.

    \section{Functional Requirements} 

    \subsection{Users}

    The system contains two different users, listed below. Further details
    about functions that each user will perform are stipulated in Section
    \ref{sec:requirements}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Manager:} These users are golf course managers or owners
            that use the web application. They primarily create or edit golf
            courses and view the positions of active players on the map.
        \item \textbf{Player:} These users are golf players that use the mobile
            application, primarily to view the course. These users are
            anonymous and do not require any authentication to access the
            application.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Subsystems (dia)}

    The system is composed of three subsystems, listed below. Further details
    about functions that each subsystem will perform are stipulated in Section
    \ref{sec:requirements}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mobile Application:} This subsystem comprises of a native
            Android mobile application that is used to view mapped courses and
            other relative information. The Google Maps API will be used for
            displaying the map received through the Mapper API, described
            below.
        \item \textbf{Web Application:} This subsystem comprises of in
            interactive web application for creating, mapping and editing
            courses, as well as viewing the location of currently active
            players. Again the Google Maps API will be used for drawing the map
            elements which are loaded and saved using the Mapper API.
        \item \textbf{Mapper API:} This subsystem covers the backend of the
            system. This subsystem further contains the following two
            subsystems:
            \subitem \textbf{DBMS:} A PostgreSQL installation with the PostGIS
            extension, used to store all information relevant information.
            \subitem \textbf{API:} A REST API using the Microsoft .NET Core
            Entity Framework, which will grant simple and secure access to the
            information stored in the database.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Interfaces}

    The next sections each describe the interfaces present in each specific
    subsystem.

        \item \textit{User:} purpose
        \item \textit{Google Maps API:} purpose
        \item \textit{Mapper API:} purpose

        \item \textit{User:} purpose
        \item \textit{Google Maps API:} purpose
        \item \textit{Mapper API:} purpose
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Mapper API (todo)}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{API/DBMS:} purpose
        \item \textit{Network:} purpose
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Styles}

    \subsubsection{System Architecture}
    
    The system is designed according to the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
    architectural pattern. This pattern is a good choice for the system as
    there is a single database responsible for storing information regarding
    mapped courses and there are multiple views that users interface with.
    
    The MVC pattern allows the abstraction of the model from the views, and
    also protects access to the model by the use of a controller. The
    abstraction created by the controller also increases the ease of
    maintaining the connection between the views and the model.

    Figure \ref{deploymentdiagram} shows the deployment diagram of the system
    and its subsystems. The different components of the MVC pattern are then
    listed as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Model} - The DBMS serves as the model component by
            storing the information required by the system. The DBMS is solely
            and exclusively responsible for the storage and retrieval of data,
            as well as enforcing integrity rules on the dataset.
        \item \textbf{Views} - The mobile app and website both serve as two
            different views. The website is a view that uses the controller to
            both create, update and destroy data stored within the model in
            order to manage the mapping of courses. The mobile app is a simpler
            view with the sole purpose of fetching and displaying data received
            from the model via the controller.
        \item \textbf{Controller} - The API serves as the controller. It acts
            as a level of abstraction between the model and the views by
            controlling the access to the model.
    \end{itemize}
