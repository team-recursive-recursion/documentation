    \section{Overview}

    \subsection{Purpose}

    This Software Requirements Specification (henceforth SRS) is intended to be
    a guide on the path of developing the Golf Course Mapper system. It will
    aid the developers by providing a layout of the project requirements.

    \subsection{Scope}

    Golf players require an application that allows them to view golf courses
    during play. Although there are existing platforms that aim to achieve this
    goal, many of them are simply mappers and do not allow the player to view
    their location on the map.
    
    Furthermore, the proprietary and commercial nature of existing products
    make them difficult to be used widely and therefore contain only a handful
    of mapped courses. The Golf Course Mapper will attempt to achieve these
    goals by providing a rich set of features for both the course managers and
    players through an open source platform.

    The Golf Course Mapper will allow golf course managers to draw the shape of
    their courses using a web application. The owners will map out the details
    of the golf course. This includes mapping the layout of the fairway, green,
    sand and water hazards and details such as the position of the hole and the
    teeing grounds. Additionally, owners will be allowed to view their courses
    and see the locations of active players currently using the mobile
    application.

    Players currently on the course will be able to use the provided mobile
    application to view the map of the course and where they are on it
    currently. This has the benefit of allowing players to plan their shots
    more strategically. The app will show the distances between the player and
    various points of interest (such as the hole), further aiding the player
    during play.

    The Golf Course Mapper is not a coaching tool and does not provide a
    channel of communication between the mapper and the player. The web
    application is not to be used by coaches, but solely by managers that wish
    to map out the details of their courses and view its current state. The
    Golf Course Mapper is also not a social media platform for golfers and will
    not allow communication among players.

    \subsection{Definitions, Acronyms \& Abbreviations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            System: Henceforth used to refer to the Golf Course Mapper system
            as a whole.
        \item
            Manager: The manager or owner of a golf course, henceforth used to
            refer to the user of the website.
        \item
            Player: A golf player, henceforth used to refer to the users of the
            mobile application.
        \item
            Website: A web application that is used by golf course managers
            to draw the layout of their golf courses.
        \item
            Mobile App: A native Android mobile app that golf players can use to
            view the golf course.
        \item
            Location: A position on the map, modelled using latitude and longitude
            coordinates.
        \item
            Point: A point of interest, such as the hole or tee location.
            Points are represented as a single location on the golf course.
        \item
            Area: Specific areas on the golf course, such as the green or the
            fairway. Areas consist of an ordered set of locations, forming a
            polygon.
        \item
            DBMS: Database Management System.
        \item
            API: Application Programming Interface.
        \item
            Back End: The server side that consists of both the DBMS and the
            API.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Domain Model}

    Refer to figure \ref{fig:domainmodel}, which represents the domain model of
    the system. At the core of the domain model is the \textit{Course} which
    represents a single area where \textit{Players} can go to play the game of
    golf. Each Player is associated with a single Course on which the Player is
    currently playing. Each Course has an assigned \textit{Manager} that is
    solely responsible for mapping and managing the information of the Course.
    Note that a Manager can be assigned to more than one Course.

    Each Course has one or more \textit{Holes} associated with it. A Hole
    represents a single playable map with different map \textit{Elements},
    containing information. The Elements can be of two different types:
    \textit{Point} Elements and \textit{Area} Elements. A Point Element
    represents single-point information of a Hole such as the teeing grounds,
    location of the hole and other points of interest. Area Elements represent
    area information of a Hole, such as the area of the rough, fairway, green
    and water and sand hazards. Areas are represented as polygons.

    A Course may also optionally have Elements that are not associated with a
    specific Hole. This allows the specification of Elements such as points of
    interest or hazardous areas such as bodies of water that may be important
    to more than one Hole. It therefore does not make sense to associate these
    Elements with a specific Hole, but rather with the Course as a whole.

    \section{Functional Requirements} 

    \subsection{Users}

    The system contains two different users, listed below. Further details
    about functions that each user will perform are stipulated in Section
    \ref{sec:requirements}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Manager:} These users are golf course managers or owners
            that use the web application. They primarily create or edit golf
            courses and view the positions of active players on the map.
        \item \textbf{Player:} These users are golf players that use the mobile
            application, primarily to view the course. These users are
            anonymous and do not require any authentication to access the
            application.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Subsystems}

    The system is composed of three subsystems, listed below. Further details
    about functions that each subsystem will perform are stipulated in Section
    \ref{sec:requirements}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mobile Application:} This subsystem comprises of a native
            Android mobile application that is used to view mapped courses and
            other relative information. The Google Maps API will be used for
            displaying the map received through the Mapper API, described
            below.
        \item \textbf{Web Application:} This subsystem comprises of in
            interactive web application for creating, mapping and editing
            courses, as well as viewing the location of currently active
            players. Again the Google Maps API will be used for drawing the map
            elements which are loaded and saved using the Mapper API.
        \item \textbf{Mapper API:} This subsystem covers the backend of the
            system. This subsystem further contains the following two
            subsystems:
            \subitem \textbf{DBMS:} A PostgreSQL installation with the PostGIS
            extension, used to store all information relevant information.
            \subitem \textbf{API:} A REST API using the Microsoft .NET Core
            Entity Framework, which will grant simple and secure access to the
            information stored in the database.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Non-Functional Requirements}

    The following sections each describe different non-functional requirements
    and briefly explain how these requirements are tested.

    \subsection{Performance Requirements}

    The system must be optimized to make as few Google Maps API calls as
    possible. The Google Maps API allows 25000 calls per day, after which the
    calls are billed.

    The performance is testing using stress testing, as layed out in the
    \textit{Testing Policy}.

    \subsection{Usability Requirements}

    Both the mobile application and web application must be made as user friendly
    as possible. The users of the system will mostly have little to no technical
    background, therefore the system must be intuitive to use.

    A tutorial video must also be provided to ensure that users can have a brief
    introduction to the system.

    Usability is tested through usability tests, as explained in the
    \textit{Testing Policy}. Briefly, this is done by presenting the web
    application or mobile application to different users, having them use the
    system and providing feedback at the end of the session.

    \newpage

    %===========================================================================

    \section{Architecture}

    \subsection{Interfaces}

    The next sections each describe the interfaces present in each specific
    subsystem.

    \subsubsection{Mobile Application}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{User:} The mobile application interfaces with the user
            through the mobile device's screen. The user's input is used to
            navigate the map and choose holes to view. The user is also
            presented with a map displaying the course and additional info.
        \item \textit{Network:} The application interfaces with the networking
            devices of the mobile device. Network connection is required to use
            the both the Mapper and Google Maps APIs.
        \item \textit{Mapper API:} The Mapper API is used to receive
            information on mapped courses, which is then displayed to the user.
        \item \textit{Google Maps API:} In order to display the information
            obtained from the Mapper API, the Google Maps API is used. The API
            allows the map to be displayed and displays the polygons and points
            on the map. The user's location is also obtained through the same
            API.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Web Application}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{User:} The web application interfaces with the user
            through the browser's display. The user is presented with various
            controls and UI elements that are used to edit courses. The user is
            also presented with a satellite map for displaying and drawing
            courses, as well as active player's locations.
        \item \textit{Mapper API:} The Mapper API is used to receive
            information on mapped courses, which is then displayed to the user.
            The mapper API is also used to create, modify or delete existing
            courses, holes or map elements.
        \item \textit{Google Maps API:} In order to display the information
            obtained from the Mapper API, the Google Maps API is used. The API
            allows the satellite map to be displayed and displays the polygons
            and points on the map. The API is also used to draw the elements on
            the map. 
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Mapper API}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{API/DBMS:} The API and the DBMS interface with one another
            through the server's internal network. The API connects to the DBMS in
            order to execute queries to create, receive, update or delete data.
        \item \textit{Network:} The API interfaces with the networking devices of
            the server. Network connection is required in order to communicate with
            the views, as explained in Section \ref{sec:sysarch}.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Styles}

    \subsubsection{System Architecture}
    \label{sec:sysarch}
    
    The system is designed according to the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
    architectural pattern. This pattern is a good choice for the system as
    there is a single database responsible for storing information regarding
    mapped courses and there are multiple views that users interface with.
    
    The MVC pattern allows the abstraction of the model from the views, and
    also protects access to the model by the use of a controller. The
    abstraction created by the controller also increases the ease of
    maintaining the connection between the views and the model.

    Figure \ref{deploymentdiagram} shows the deployment diagram of the system
    and its subsystems. The different components of the MVC pattern are then
    listed as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Model} - The DBMS serves as the model component by
            storing the information required by the system. The DBMS is solely
            and exclusively responsible for the storage and retrieval of data,
            as well as enforcing integrity rules on the dataset.
        \item \textbf{Views} - The mobile app and website both serve as two
            different views. The website is a view that uses the controller to
            both create, update and destroy data stored within the model in
            order to manage the mapping of courses. The mobile app is a simpler
            view with the sole purpose of fetching and displaying data received
            from the model via the controller.
        \item \textbf{Controller} - The API serves as the controller. It acts
            as a level of abstraction between the model and the views by
            controlling the access to the model.
    \end{itemize}

    %\subsubsection{Mapper API Architecture}

    %Blackboard? \ldots

    \subsection{Configuration}

    The Web Application and Mapper API will both be hosted on a Microsoft Azure
    Web Server. This includes the PostgreSQL DBMS, .NET Core Entity Framework
    and the Angular web service.

    The mobile app will be available on the Google Play Store for download on
    any mobile device that hosts an Android system above version 4.4 (KitKat).
    Finally, the web application will be available through a public URL that
    can be accessed by any course managers that wish to use the web
    application.

    The deployment diagram in figure \ref{fig:depdia} illustrates the
    configuration of the system.
